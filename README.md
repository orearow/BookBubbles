# BookBubbles

My research project for Computer science 503.07 
Generates a "Book bubble" out of the information in csv files (data from the goodreads api call book.show) ex csv file 'Dune.csv
each book bubble consists of 100 tags that the book is related to 
tags are organized by "size" (how many users have voted for the tag) 
run index.html on either firefox or chrome (using the server plugin) or an IDE (like NetBeans)
